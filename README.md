# Sidekick - An Interactive University Information System Installation

Introducing Sidekick, an interactive information kiosk that utilizes natural user interface (NUI) concepts and methods to create a more intuitive and engaging experience for university students and staff. Developed using Unity game engine and Microsoft Kinect V2 as the natural interaction device, Sidekick's first iteration focused on a user-centered approach with UI designed in accordance with Fitts' Law. In a project expo, visitors found Sidekick easy to use, though some experienced a delay between hand movement and screen response. While discussing limitations such as face recognition absence and low number of Sidekick test participants, this project highlights NUI's potential for enhancing user experience and offers insights into designing and developing interactive information systems.
